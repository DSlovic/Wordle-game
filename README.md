# DS-REP
This is a repository, where I keep some of my projects, that I worked on while I was a student. They are public, so that they can be viewed by potential employers. 
If you are interested in Java code, check out the activity_igra.java file, where most of the work went in.
There are also props I used in the drawable folder.
Check out "Wordle game Documentation EN.pdf" PDF file for better idea of the project. Note that this file is originally written in serbian. 
The original file is named "Readme.pdf".
